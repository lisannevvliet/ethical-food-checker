## Description
The Ethical Food Checker is designed to help consumers make more responsible choices in the supermarket. By typing in the product name or barcode of a product, the user can find out in less than a minute whether the product is vegetarian or vegan, and what its Eco-Score is. The website uses the Open Food Facts API and only shows products that are available in the Netherlands.
